Microvascular Image Analysis

This is an independent project where I am developing image-processing scripts inspired by the MATLAB pipelines I built during my MSc in Biomedical Engineering. I am recreating and extending those MATLAB-style methods in Python using Anaconda so I can run and expand the work on my personal machine. The goal is to study preprocessing, vessel extraction and simple motion analysis on microvascular images.

The project is motivated by challenges I encountered during clinical imaging work, especially motion artefacts, low-contrast vessels and difficulties extracting reproducible structural or flow information. Building this repository helps me strengthen my computational foundations and prepare for more advanced work in high-speed, wide-field microvascular imaging.
